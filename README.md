# Classifying Land Use via Satellite Images
![cover_photo](satellite_image.png)

Images of the Earth taken by satellites in orbit are a data source found in abundance all over the internet. Many governmental space agencies (such as NASA) even make their full catalog freely open and accessible to the public via the NASA Earth Observatory website (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov). This provides an incredibly powerful way for a person located anywhere to obtain data about the conditions of any location on Earth at a particular point in time. This data has many obvious use cases, and some not so obvious.
 Identifying potential sites for resource extraction sites (mineral mining)
High resolution satellite images are used by engineers in the planning of new projects, identifying potential geological roadblocks to new construction of buildings or infrastructure 
Disaster relief mitigation: Quickly identifying hardest hit areas, assisting with assessment and prioritization of relief 
State Defense: Monitoring strategic regions & facilities of hostile nations (ie. North Korean nuclear program)
Assessing quantity and quality of arable land in use for agriculture  
Estimating climate induced changes across a variety of geographical features (ie. ice melt, coastal land loss etc.)
Targeting government poverty alleviation programs based on infrastructure and housing materials in images
Despite the abundance of data, satellite imagery remains a  difficult source to parse, as image quality and resolution can be affected by a variety of factors, the main culprit being weather. This makes the ability to classify landscape types, and objects within them a valuable and challenging asset for accomplishing any of the tasks listed above. 
	



## 1. Data

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) performs a number of different types of remote sensing data collections around the country, and makes their research publicly available. One of their projects is the “National Map Urban Area Imagery” collection of satellite images,
